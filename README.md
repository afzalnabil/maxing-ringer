# maxring
`Method A` Locks the ringer volume to max state, gets triggered only when VOL- key is pressed or when volume is decreased through the OS. Trigger-based, so expect minimal battery drain

`Method B` Time-based, checks ringer volume level at fixed intervals, and maxes it out if it's not maxed out already. Might cause more battery drain than method A depending on interval set
